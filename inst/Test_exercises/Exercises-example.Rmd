```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
SDSdata::sds_setup()
show_answer = TRUE
verbose = TRUE
format = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), "latex", "html")
```

Procedure:

- The `include_exercise()` function translates the problem Rmd into markdown
    - If output is html, you're done at this point and you just need to set the CSS.
    - If output is postscript, **ignore** the pdf file and start with the **tex** intermediate.
         - In the tex intermediate,  substitute the START-ANSWER stuff into tex commands.
         - Recompile the modified tex file to PDF.
         
Write a function that takes a data-frame of problem files and corresponding names and produces
a complete sequence of data to include.

FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCLUDE THE CSS for the exercise answers in this file.
